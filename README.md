# Tic Tac Toe



Tic Tac Toe is X and O game where both players take turn to make a move and compete to win . It's a pretty easy game to win , and you can have different schemes to win it.

 I used a JavaScript function with an if statement to change turns between two players, after the players finish their game there will be either one winner or a toe; where no one wins, to be able to do this I used an if statement to determine the winner and called the function. 

After the game is finished, the user can press a button to relaod the page and start a new game.
